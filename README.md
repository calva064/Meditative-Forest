Meditative Forest (2023) began with an exploration into creating an experimental camera using my webcam’s live video feed. I chose to play with texture using the video input from my computer, specifically the video pixels’ rgb values. I soon realized that the feather-like shapes produced resembled trees upside down, so I was inspired to make tweaks to the code to create an immersive, online, forest experience.
